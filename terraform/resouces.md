IAC-Infrastructure as code

In traditional IT and challenges

Buiseness-Buiseness analyste-solution arch-teams like n/w-

this process will take 

Challenges or issue-

1.slow deployment 
2.Expensive
3.Limited Automation
4.Human error
5.wasted Resource
6.Inconsistance

Infrastructure As code-IAC

IAC write and execture code to create provision or destroy the resoucres.
database,network,storage
Types of IAC-

1.Configuration Management-Ansible,puppet,saltstack,shef
- They are idempotent-you can run code multiple times but only make changes that are required to make env in desied state
- Designed to install and manage software
- version control
- maintain standard structure


2.Server Templating-docker,hashicorp packer,hashicorp vagrant
- vm image,docker image(ami in aws)
- immutable 
- we need to update image and update
- immutable infrastructure-once its deployed it is designed to remain unchanged.we need to update image and redeploy instance.

3.Provisioning Tools-terraform,clodformation
- provision Infrastructure,vm,db,vpc,subnets,sg,
- cloudformation used only on aws where as terraform is vendor agnostic
- Deploy immutable infrastructure resources

Terraform-
- terraform uses HCL(hashicorp Configuration Language)
- free and open source
- Infrastructure provision Tools-
- free and opensource developed by hashicorp
- used to provision infrastructure across multiple platform aws,gcp,azure,vmware

Provider-

Providers helps tf to manage platform through api.enaled tf aws,gcp

Terraform uses HCL-Hashicorp Configuration Language-
main.tf -.tf configuration files-

code is declaratativate-meaning the code is defined is the state we want our infrastructure to be in.current state.

tf takes care of current and desired state-

There are three 
1.init-initialise project and identifies providers
2.plan-draft plans to reach target
3.apply-makes changes to reach desired state.fixing mixing


Resouce-db,compute instance execture
lifecycle of resoucres

terraform.tfstate
is blueprint


Installing terraform-

www.terraform.id



HCL Basics-
blocks-infrastructure and set if resources
1.<block> <parameter>{
    key1= value1
    key2 = value2
}

resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = "/root/pets.txt"
    content = "happy learning"
}

resource -is block-name
local_file-resoucres Type,local provider file resource,local is provider
pet-resource name can be anything logical name
{}-define argument,specific to type of resource we are creating


Simple terrafrom execution flow consist of four steps-
1.init-
2.plan-
3.apply-


Example
1.terraform init-
downloads plugin
Initializes Backend ‚Äì Configures where Terraform stores its state (e.g., local or remote like S3).

Installs Providers ‚Äì Downloads the necessary provider plugins (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).

Prepares the Working Directory ‚Äì Validates configuration files and sets up dependencies.

2.terraform plan-it will not create anything it will create 
shows actions which is performed-



3.terraform apply -applies files


1Ô∏è‚É£ terraform plan -out=tfplan

Creates an execution plan and saves it to a file (tfplan).
This ensures that the exact plan is applied later, preventing unintended changes.

terraform plan -out=tfplan
This generates a binary file (tfplan), which stores the Terraform execution plan.

2Ô∏è‚É£ terraform apply tfplan

Applies the saved plan (tfplan) instead of generating a new one.
Ensures that the changes being applied match what was previously reviewed.


 
üìå Why Use This Approach?
‚úÖ Prevents unexpected changes (since the plan does not change between plan and apply).
‚úÖ Ensures approval before execution, making it useful for review processes in teams.
‚úÖ Essential for CI/CD pipelines, where you generate a plan, get approval, and then apply it later.


n Terraform, you can assign values to variables in several ways. Here's a breakdown of the most common methods:

‚úÖ 1. In a terraform.tfvars file
Create a file named terraform.tfvars:

hcl
Copy
Edit
region = "us-west-2"
instance_type = "t3.micro"
Terraform will automatically load this file when you run terraform plan or terraform apply.

‚úÖ 2. Directly in the CLI using -var
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -var="region=us-west-2" -var="instance_type=t3.micro"
‚úÖ 3. In environment variables
Use TF_VAR_ prefix:

bash
Copy
Edit
export TF_VAR_region="us-west-2"
export TF_VAR_instance_type="t3.micro"
‚úÖ 4. In a variable definition file (.tf or .tfvars)
You can create your own file like prod.tfvars:

h
Copy
Edit
# prod.tfvars
region = "us-east-1"
Then use it with:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars"
‚úÖ 5. Default value in the variable block
Inside your .tf file:

h
Copy
Edit
variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "us-east-1"
}
If no other value is provided, Terraform uses the default.


variable defination precedence

order option
1  env variable
2 terraform.tfvars
3.auto.tfvars
4. -var or -var-file command line flag


important command-
1.terraform init
2.terraform plan
3.terraform apply
4.terraform validate-check validate format and if it correct
5.terraform fmt-format
6.terraform show  -json
7.terraform output
8.terraform refresh
9.terraform graph


Mutable vs Imutable

updating 


lifecycle rules
if we donot want decide the lifecycle of events create before destory etc


lifecycle={
  ignore_changes=[
    tags
  ]
  create_before_destroy = true
}

data sources use data from files not provide by terraform 
 


meta argument
depends on 
lifecycle
